- **Breadcrumbs**: Navigation breadcrumb components.
- **Cards**: Various card layouts for displaying statistics, info, etc.
- **Charts**: Chart components (likely using a charting library) for data visualization.
- **Configurator**: The UI for the theme configurator (settings sidebar).
- **Footer**: Application footer components.
- **Navbars**: Top navigation bar components.
- **Sidenav**: Side navigation menu components.
- **Tables**: Data table components.
- **Timeline**: Timeline visualization components.
- **LayoutContainers**: Wrapper components for different page layouts.

## Usage

These generic blocks are assembled in the `layouts` directory to create full application pages.
